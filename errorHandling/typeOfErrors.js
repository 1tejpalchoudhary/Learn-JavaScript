// Syntax error
/*

    These occur when there are mistakes in your code's syntax, such as missing semicolons, parentheses,
    or incorrect variable names. They prevent the code from running at all.



// Runtime error

    These occur during code execution and can be caused by various factors, such as division by zero, 
    undefined variables, or attempting to access properties of null or undefined objects.




//logical error


    These are the most challenging to detect and occur when your code produces unexpected results,
    even though it runs without any syntax or runtime errors. These errors often require debugging to
    identify and fix.
